CrossCraft-SurvivalTest is a project that aims to implement Minecraft Java Edition: Classic Survival Test. It is not a clone. CrossCraft does not use any of the source code of the original game, nor do the developers have any knowledge of the source code. CrossCraft does not use the original copyrighted assets. All knowledge is figured out with documentation and observation of in-game mechanics.

Textures are a combination of handmade and adaptations from [Unity Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/unity) under CC0

CrossCraft's goal is to be platform-independent and work across all PC platforms and many major game consoles. CrossCraft supports Windows, Mac, Linux, PSP, and PS Vita. Further support will be added over time as systems change and upgrade. The next planned platform is the PS2.

## Version Compatibility

Each individual Survival Test update is not meant to be reflective of every step of the 4 main Survival Test phases. It is a rapid development phase to reach 0.28 Survival Test.

CrossCraft Classic world imports are not yet supported, but will be in the future.
